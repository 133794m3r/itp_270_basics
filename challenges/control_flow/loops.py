"""
Take all numbers from 1 to 110
(inclusive meaning your counter should reach 110 before ending the loop)
 and multiply it by itself plus 2 and then add that to our running total
An example is below for the numbers 1  to 3(inclusive).

0) total = 0.
1) Start with the number 1.
2) 1*(1+2) = 2.
3) Add it to the total. total = total + 2.
4) 2*(2+2) = 8.
5) Add 8 to the total. total = total +8. Total is now 10.
6) 3*(3+2) = 15.
7) Add 15 to the total. total = total + 15. The total is now 25.
8) Now you have your total and the answer would be 25.

You can use a "for" or a "while" loop to get your answer.
