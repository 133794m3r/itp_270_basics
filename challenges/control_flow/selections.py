"""Challenge is given below:

You are given the list of numbers below. Go through all of the numbers in that list.
If the number is divisible by 4 add it to the resulting list. If it is not do not add it.

An example is right below here.
If you were given the list of numbers [1,3,5,6]
Go through them and create a list of numbers that are even.

results = []
1) Start with 1. It's less than 4 so we don't add it.
2) Is 3 divisible by 3? yes because 1*3 = 3. So we add it to the resulting list.
3) Is 5 divisible by 3? No so we skip it.
4) Is 6 divisble by 3? Yes. Because 2*3 = 6. So we add it to the resulting list.
5) The results list now looks like this when you print it out [3, 6].
That is then your flag. You don't have to worry about whether or not your
resulting list has a space between the comma all that matters is that the values are in it.

The numbers below are very large but the rules for modulus still apply to them.
